# TOC / SIG Lead Meeting Notes (2019)

## 4/30/19

* SIG-driven issue triage
  * Open to adopting & revisiting after a couple months
	* Concerns: From UI perspective, can get issues related to specific cloud providers
    * Resolution: Issues can be tagged with multiple sigs
	* TOC to add sig labels, etc
		* And docs on processes
		* Should also have a product-mgmt label for broader features requests, etc
	* A good potential way to get better at saying “No” to issues.
* TravisCI replacement update
	* Waiting to hear on CDF infra; on-hold
* SIG-driven technical roadmap
	* Where to put it? —> Next point
	* What to put in it?
		* Specific to tasks and features owned by a SIG
	* TOC not product management
		* Should work on tooling (?) of helping bubble up SIG roadmaps
* Community repo
  * Goal is to make governance, top-to-bottom more transparent for the community
  * Warm reception from SIGL
* Spinnaker Summit
	* CFP Review Involvement
		* July 15(?) deadline
	* TOC & SIG Leads to review initially
	* Please evangelize
* ETC?
	* Cadence & duration is good for now
